### How to Play
In Yugioh terms:
1. Start YGOPro.
2. Optional: Disable `Auto chain order` in the Settings tab in Deck Editor. If the option is enabled, always choose the chain order from left to right.
3. Click on `Deck Edit` to build your deck. Remember to add 1 *Pokemon Rules* to your extra deck!<br>
If you do not build your deck according to the following rules, you will lose the duel and have to rebuild your deck:<br>
	-Your main deck must be exactly 60 cards.<br>
	-All 60 cards must be Pokémon cards. You cannot have any non-Pokémon cards in your deck.<br>
	-There must be at least 1 "[Basic Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Basic_Pok%C3%A9mon_(TCG))" monster in your deck.<br>
	-You cannot have more than 1 "[Miracle Energy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Miracle_Energy_(Neo_Destiny_16))" in your deck.<br>
	-You cannot have more than 1 "[Pokémon ☆](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_%E2%98%86_(TCG))" monster in your deck.<br>
	-You cannot have more than 1 "[ACE SPEC](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ace_Spec_card_(TCG))" card in your deck.<br>
	-You cannot have 4 of each half of a "[Pokémon LEGEND](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_LEGEND_(TCG))" monster in your deck. (e.g. 4 "[Lugia LEGEND](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lugia_LEGEND_(HeartGold_%26_SoulSilver_113))" top half and 4 "Lugia LEGEND" bottom half)<br>
	-You cannot have both "[Professor Juniper](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Juniper_(Black_%26_White_101))" and "[Professor Sycamore](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Sycamore_(XY_122))" in your deck.
4. Begin the duel by drawing 7 cards, then place 1 "Basic Pokémon" monster from your hand in an extra monster zone face-down as your [Active Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Active_Pok.C3.A9mon).<br>
If you do not have a "Basic Pokémon" monster in your hand, show your hand, shuffle it into the deck, then draw 7 cards. Repeat this until you have a "Basic Pokémon" monster in your hand.<br>
5. Optional: Place any number of "Basic Pokémon" monsters from your hand in your main monster zones face-down as Pokémon on the [Bench](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Bench).<br>
6. Set aside the top 6 cards of your deck as [Prize cards](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Prize_Card), then your life points become equal to the number of Prize cards you have.<br>
7. Optional: Your opponent draws a number of cards, up to the number of times you shuffled your hand into the deck because you did not have a "Basic Pokémon" monster in your hand.<br>
8. Flip all face-down cards on your field face-up.
9. During your draw phase, draw 1 card, regardless if it is the first turn of the duel. If you cannot, you lose the duel. (There is no limit to the number of cards in your hand.)
10. Nothing happens during your standby phase.
11. Optional: During your main phase 1, do any of the following:<br>
	-Special summon any number of "Basic Pokémon" monsters from your hand.<br>
	-Special summon any number of "[Evolution](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Evolution_card)" monsters from your hand, by stacking them on top of a card in the main monster zone or extra monster zone that has its name listed in its text, except if that card was special summoned this turn, or if it is the first turn of the duel. (This is treated as an evolution summon.)<br>
	-Activate the effect of an "[Energy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Energy_card_(TCG))" card in your hand and attach it to 1 of your monsters as a material. (You can only do this once per turn.)<br>
	-Activate any number of "[Trainer](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trainer_card_(TCG))" cards from your hand. (You can only activate 1 "Supporter" and 1 "Stadium" card per turn.)<br>
	-Retreat your Active Pokémon, by switching its place with 1 monster on your Bench and detaching "Energy" cards equal to its Level [(Retreat Cost)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Retreat_cost). (You can only do this once per turn.)<br>
	-Activate or apply any monster effects.<br>
	-If it is not the first turn of the duel and you have the "Energy" cards attached to your Active Pokémon that are listed in its text, you can activate its effect to [attack](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Attack_(TCG)) the opponent's Active Pokémon. Place [Damage Counters](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_(TCG)#Damage) on that opponent's monster, equal to the number listed in your monster's text, divide by 10. (Monsters with a Damage Counter lose 10 ATK for each Damage Counter on it, also are destroyed when their ATK become 0 as a result.) If that opponent's monster is destroyed, add 1 Prize card to your hand, then your opponent's life points become equal to the number of Prize cards you have left. Your main phase 1 ends.
12. You cannot conduct your battle phase.
13. During your end phase, activate or apply any [appropriate effects](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_Conditions_(TCG)), then your turn ends.

### How to Win
1. At any time, if your opponent's monster(s) is destroyed, add 1 Prize card to your hand for each destroyed monster, then your opponent's life points become equal to the number of Prize cards you have left. When you take your last Prize card, you win the duel. (Your opponent's life points are reduced to 0.)
2. At any time, if your opponent controls no monsters. (If their only monster is destroyed.)
3. If your opponent cannot draw a card for their normal draw during their draw phase.
4. [Some cards](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/pokemon-cards/?cardName=&cardText=win+this+game&evolvesFrom=&simpleSubmit=&format=unlimited&particularArtist=&sort=number&sort=number) will allow you to win by other means.
